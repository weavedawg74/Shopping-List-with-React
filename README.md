Design a simple tool that will allow the user to add shopping items to a list, the user will be to select their desired item category from a dropdown list and have the item added to the approriate section based on their selection.

## Installation Instructions:
1. Download the files from Github
2. Naviagate to the 'src' folder and open the App.js file in your local editor
3. Ensure that you have npm installed on your local machine
4. In the command terminal enter '*npm run start*' and the file should open properly in your browser

## User Stories:
* As a user I want to create a shopping list that I can use on my phone so that I can keep track of what I would like to get.
* As a user I want to be able to assign items to the categories so that it better suits my shopping habits or store layout.
* As a user I want to be able to cross items off my list as I pick them up so that I know what I still need to pick up.

## Technolgies used for this project:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Bootstrap
* React
* SASS
* Git

## Future Improvements:
1. I would like to add the ability to share/save the list with other users(family) that would allow them to add items to the list without losing any of the previously added data.
2. I would like to have a automatically updating crowdsourced database with items that have previously been added, this would allow the possibilty of auto-categorizing items based on past inputs and also allow suggestions as the user starts typing.
3. With the database I would also like to add the ability to paste in ingredient lists and sort them appropriately.

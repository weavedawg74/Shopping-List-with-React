# Shopping-List

## Overview:

Design a simple tool that will allow the user to add shopping items to a list, the user will be to select their desired item category from a dropdown list and have the item added to the approriate section based on their selection.

# Requirements:

## User Stories:
* As a user I want to create a shopping list that I can use on my phone so that I can keep track of what I would like to get.
* As a user I want to be able to assign items to the categories so that it better suits my shopping habits or store layout.
* As a user I want to be able to cross items off my list as I pick them up so that I know what I still need to pick up.

## Technolgies used for this project:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Bootstrap
* React
* SASS
* Git

## Future Improvements:
1. I would like to add the ability to share/save the list with other users(family) that would allow them to add items to the list without losing any of the previously added data.
2. I would like to have a automatically updating crowdsourced database with items that have previously been added, this would allow the possibilty of auto-categorizing items based on past inputs and also allow suggestions as the user starts typing.
3. With the database I would also like to add the ability to paste in ingredient lists and sort them appropriately.
